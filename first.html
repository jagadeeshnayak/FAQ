                FAQ pages serve multiple purposes. They improve customer service by providing readily available answers to common inquiries,
                 reducing the need for direct support interactions. This enhances user experience by making information easily accessible and
                  improving website navigation. By proactively addressing concerns, FAQs build trust and credibility. They also reduce support
                   costs by minimizing inquiries and can improve SEO by providing valuable, searchable content. Furthermore, FAQs educate customers,
                    increase satisfaction, onboard new users, and support sales and marketing efforts. Finally, by analyzing frequently asked questions,
                     companies gain valuable insights into customer needs and preferences.
